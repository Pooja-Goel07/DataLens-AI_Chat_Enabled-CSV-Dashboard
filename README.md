# 📊 DataLens — AI Chat-Enabled-CSV-Dashboard

**DataLens** is an intelligent, web-based CSV explorer built for data analysts, students, and developers who want instant insights from structured data. Featuring a chatbot powered by Google Gemini (2.5 Flash), it allows users to upload CSV files, analyze them, and ask questions in natural language — all from a sleek and simple web interface.

## 🌐 Real-World Use Case
